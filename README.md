# Basic-Machine-Learning-Practice
## Introduction
This project is aimed to implement several basic machine learning algorithms which I learn from the machine learning course provided in National Chiao Tung University. To be more familiar with these algorithms, I won't use any existing library as possible as I can. For more details, you can refer to each directory.

## Environment  
1. python >= 3
